This page describes the data objects used in StanfordNLP, and how they interact with each other.

## Document

A `Document` object holds the annotation of an entire document, and is automatically generated when a string is annotated by the `Pipeline`. It holds a collection of sentences (`Sentence`) and entities (`Span`), and can be seamlessly translated into a dict.

Objects of the Document class contain these properties:

| Property | Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| text | str | The raw text of the document. |
| sentences | List[Sentence] | The list of sentences for this document. |
| entities (ents) | List[Span] | The list of entities in this document. |
| num_tokens | int | The number of tokens for this document. | 
| num_words | int | The number of words for this document. |

Objects of the Document class contain these methods:

| Method | Return Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| to_dict | dict | Dumps the whole document into a list of list of dictionary for each token in each sentence in the doc. |

## Sentence

A `Sentence` object represents a sentence (as is predicted by the [tokenizer](/tokenize.html)), and holds a list of the tokens (`Token`) in the sentence, a list of all its words (`Word`), as well as a list of the entities (`Span`). 

Objects of the Sentence class contain these properties:

| Property | Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| doc | Document | The parent doc of this span. |
| text | str | The raw text for this sentence. |
| dependencies | List[(Word, str, Word)] | The list of dependencies for this sentence. |
| tokens | List[Token] | The list of tokens for this sentence. |
| words | List[Word] | The list of words for this sentence. |
| entities (ents) | List[Span] | The list of entities in this sentence. | 

Objects of the Sentence class contain these methods:

| Method | Return Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| to_dict | dict | Dumps the sentence into a list of dictionary for each token in the sentence. |
| print_dependencies | None | Print the dependencies for this sentence. |
| print_tokens | None | Print the tokens for this sentence. | 
| print_words | None | Print the words for this sentence. |

## Token

A `Token` object holds a token, and a list of its underlying words (`Word`). In the event that the token is a [multi-word token](https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/tokenization.html) (e.g., French _au = Ã  le_), the token will have a range `id` as described in the [CoNLL-U format specifications](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html#words-tokens-and-empty-nodes) (e.g., `3-4`), with its `words` property containing the underlying `Word`s. In other cases, the `Token` object will be a simple wrapper around one `Word` object, where its `words` property is a singleton.

Objects of the Token class contain these properties:

| Property | Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | int | The index of this token. |
| text | str | The text of this token. Example: 'The'. |
| misc | str | The miscellaneousness of this token. |
| words | List[Word] | The list of syntactic words underlying this token. |
| start_char | int | The start character index for this token in the raw text. |
| end_char | int | The end character index for this token in the raw text. |
| ner | str | The NER tag of this token. Example: 'B-ORG'. |

Objects of the Token class contain these methods:

| Method | Return Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| to_dict | dict | Dumps the token into a list of dictionary for this token with its extended words if the token is a multi-word token. |
| pretty_print | str | Print this token with its extended words in one line. |

## Word

A `Word` object holds a syntactic word and all of its word-level annotations. In the example of multi-word tokens (MWT), these are generated as a result of [multi-word token expansion](/mwt.html), and are used in all downstream syntactic analyses such as tagging, lemmatization, and parsing. If a `Word` is the result from an MWT expansion, its `text` will usually not be found in the input raw text. Aside from multi-word tokens, `Word`s should be similar to the familiar "tokens" one would see elsewhere.

Objects of the Word class contain these properties:

| Property | Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | int | The index of this word. |
| text | str | The text of this word. Example: 'The'. |
| lemma | str | The lemma of this word. |
| upos (pos) | str | The universal part-of-speech of this word. Example: 'NOUN'. |
| xpos | str | The treebank-specific part-of-speech of this word. Example: 'NNP'. | 
| feats | str | The morphological features of this word. Example: 'Gender=Fem'. |
| head | int | The id of the governer of this word. |
| deprel | str | The dependency relation of this word. Example: 'nmod'. |
| deps | str | The dependencies of this word. |
| misc | str | The miscellaneousness of this word. |
| parent | Token | The parent token of this word. In the case of a multi-word token, a token can be the parent of multiple words. |

Objects of the Word class contain these methods:

| Method | Return Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| to_dict | dict | Dumps the word into a dictionary. |
| pretty_print | str | Print the word in one line. |

## Span

A `Span` object stores attributes of a textual span. A range of objects (e.g., named entities) can be represented as a `Span`.

Objects of the Span class contain these properties:

| Property | Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| doc | Document | The parent doc of this span. |
| text | str | The text of this span. |
| tokens | List[Token] | The list of tokens that correspond to this span. |
| words | List[Word] | The list of words that correspond to this span. |
| type | str | The type of this span. Example: 'PERSON'. |
| start_char | int | The start character offset of this span. |
| end_char | int | The end character offset of this span. |

Objects of the Span class contain these methods:

| Method | Return Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| to_dict | dict | Dumps the span into a dictionary. |
| pretty_print | str | Print the span in one line. |
